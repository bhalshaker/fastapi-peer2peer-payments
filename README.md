# fastapi-peer2peer-payments
A simple peer-to-peer payment system developed with FastAPI that allows users to send money to each other. The application supports user registration and login with JWT-based authentication, enabling secure access to user-specific features. Users can view their account balance, transaction history, and send money to other users, including automatic currency conversion with real-time exchange rates and a processing fee. Admin users have additional privileges to view the transaction history of any selected user. All endpoints enforce strict validation and authorization, ensuring only authenticated users can access sensitive operations. The simple system demonistrates the developer ability to design a fastapi webservices which provides clear error responses for invalid requests, insufficient permissions, or missing data, and maintains robust handling of user and transaction records.

## Getting started

### Data model
This application has a simple data model:
* UserModel: Contains users data and has one to one relationship with AccountModel meaning each user has one account only.
* AccountModel: Contains user account data and each account belongs to one user only.
* TransactionModel: Each transaction has a relationship with valid accounts and points to sender and receiver accounts.
