# fastapi-peer2peer-payments
A simple peer-to-peer payment system developed with FastAPI that allows users to send money to each other. The application supports user registration and login with JWT-based authentication, enabling secure access to user-specific features. Users can view their account balance, transaction history, and send money to other users, including automatic currency conversion with real-time exchange rates and a processing fee. Admin users have additional privileges to view the transaction history of any selected user. All endpoints enforce strict validation and authorization, ensuring only authenticated users can access sensitive operations. The simple system demonistrates the developer ability to design a fastapi webservices which provides clear error responses for invalid requests, insufficient permissions, or missing data, and maintains robust handling of user and transaction records.

## Getting started

### Data model
This application has a simple data model:
* UserModel: Contains users data and has one to one relationship with AccountModel meaning each user has one account only.
* AccountModel: Contains user account data and each account belongs to one user only.
* TransactionModel: Each transaction has a relationship with valid accounts and points to sender and receiver accounts.

## Technologies used

| üì¶ Language/Library/Component | üß† Justification|
|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Python 3.11**            | To make sure that python run time supports all choosen libraries in this project|
| **FastAPI**  | Web framework for building APIs|
| **Asyncpg**  | Python driver library to connect to PostgreSQL Database it is faster than psycopg and does not require installation for postgresql tools on the system as it is capable of running by it is own|
| **SQLAlchemy** | Python wide known ORM library and some libraries such as SQLModel are built on top of it |
| **argon2-cffi** without Passlib |Argon2 by it self is an award winning library and it is been decided that only one hashing algorithm is going to be used and thus using a passlibrary is not essential in additional to that passlib is not actively maintained |
| **Pytest** | Test the application|
| **Pyjwt** | To deal with JWT tokens |
| **Uvicorn** | Production ASGI Server to run the wen APIS|
